Trying to create a programmatic way of creating a dashboard to show certain economic statistics.

Will run the WDI dataset from the World Data Bank through K-Means clustering algorithms to identify data correlations that impact life expectancy in the EU and UK, from 2000-2023.

Will then try to provide some sort of reccomendations through a Power BI report and dashboard.
